# 2021-Junior-Breakers-Website-Project

This Website was created uisng bootstrap and a little bit of jQuery, it's paritally responsive because I got it to quite scale dynamically as you resized your window rather than having set media query defintiions (which I was trying to avoid). The Website usually starts to break when the Website is too zoomed out.

Tl;dr
Written in:
- Uses Bootstrap CSS framework,
- Uses a bit of jQuery for some features.
Aims:
- Tried to make a dynamically resizing Website which didn't rely on Media queries,
- Tried to make a more unique
- Tried out bootstrap which was quite nice instead of having to styling elements from scratch
